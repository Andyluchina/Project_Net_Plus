Although xv6 is a succinct and robust teaching OS, it lacks some of the core functionalities
that a modern OS would require. One of these functionalities is networking support: it
is difficult to imagine an OS that canâ€™t be connected to the Internet. Plus, the current
QEMU environment already has a networking device that has not been used. Thus, we
humbly propose Project Net Plus, a project that will introduce networking support to
xv6. Additional Benchmarking was also done to evaluate the performance of the driver.
