Although xv6 is a succinct and robust teaching OS, it lacks some of the core functionalities that a modern OS would require. One of these functionalities is networking support: it is difficult to imagine an OS that canâ€™t be connected to the Internet. Plus, the current qemu environment already has a networking device that has not been used. Thus, we humbly propose Project Net Plus, a project that will introduce not only networking support but also a set of auxiliary functionalities such as TLS security and device tree to xv6.
